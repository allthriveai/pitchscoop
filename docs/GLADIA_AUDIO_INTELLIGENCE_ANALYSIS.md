# Gladia Audio Intelligence Analysis & Alternatives

*Generated: 2025-09-19*

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current state of Gladia's Audio Intelligence features in PitchScoop, identifies limitations, and recommends alternatives for improved sentiment and emotion analysis in pitch competitions.

## Current Gladia Audio Intelligence Implementation

### Features Currently Configured

PitchScoop is configured to use Gladia's Audio Intelligence features including:

1. **Sentiment Analysis** - Detects positive, neutral, or negative sentiment in speech segments
2. **Emotion Analysis** - Identifies emotional states like "positive_surprise", "neutral", etc.
3. **Speaker Identification** - Distinguishes between different speakers
4. **Summarization** - Generates content summaries
5. **Named Entity Recognition** - Identifies people, places, organizations
6. **Chapterization** - Segments audio into logical chapters

### Technical Implementation

#### Configuration Structure
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AudioConfiguration:
    # Audio Intelligence Features
    sentiment_analysis: bool = False
    emotion_analysis: bool = False
    speaker_identification: bool = False
    summarization: bool = False
    named_entity_recognition: bool = False
    chapterization: bool = False
    translation: bool = False
    target_language: str = None
```

#### Current Data Flow
1. **Audio Recording** → Browser uploads to MinIO
2. **STT Processing** → Gladia WebSocket/Batch API
3. **Intelligence Extraction** → Sentiment/emotion per segment
4. **Storage** → Redis with structured analysis
5. **Analysis** → Custom scoring based on speech patterns

## What You're Currently Getting

### Gladia Output Structure
```json
{
  "transcript_segments": [
    {
      "text": "That's very good.",
      "sentiment": "positive",
      "emotion": "positive_surprise",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "speaker": 0,
      "start_time": 2.54438,
      "end_time": 3.5432
    }
  ],
  "intelligence_data": {
    "sentiment_analysis": {...},
    "emotion_analysis": {...}
  }
}
```

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Per-segment sentiment**: Basic positive/negative/neutral classification
- **Per-segment emotion**: Limited emotional categories
- **Real-time processing**: Through WebSocket API (limited AI features)
- **Batch processing**: More comprehensive but with payload size constraints
- **Custom metrics**: Speech rate, filler analysis, confidence scoring

## Current Limitations & Issues

### 1. Technical Limitations (RESOLVED ✅)
- ~~**Batch API Payload Size**: 413 "request entity too large" errors due to base64 encoding overhead~~ **FIXED**: Now using proper multipart/form-data upload
- **WebSocket AI Constraints**: Audio Intelligence features primarily designed for batch processing  
- ~~**Size Thresholds**: Even 2-second clips (~135KB) cause batch API rejections~~ **FIXED**: Now supports up to 10MB audio files (3+ minute pitches)
- **Fallback Quality**: WebSocket transcription produces empty segments

### 2. Analysis Quality Issues
- **Basic Classification**: Simple positive/negative/neutral sentiment categories
- **Limited Emotions**: Few emotional categories with unclear confidence metrics
- **Low Confidence Scores**: Transcript confidence typically below 0.3
- **Generic Analysis**: Not specialized for pitch competition context

### 3. Integration Challenges
- **API Reliability**: Frequent timeouts and processing failures
- **Feature Conflicts**: Audio Intelligence vs. real-time streaming trade-offs
- **Configuration Complexity**: Different settings for batch vs. WebSocket APIs

## Alternative Solutions Analysis
