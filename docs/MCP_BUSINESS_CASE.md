# PitchScoop MCP: Real-Time Hackathon Intelligence Platform

## The Real Problem: Competitions Lack Intelligence

**Current Reality**: Hackathons and pitch competitions are "dumb" events:
- ❌ Presentations happen once, then disappear into the void
- ❌ No way to interact with or query what teams actually said
- ❌ Judges make snap decisions without deep analysis
- ❌ No connection between practice sessions and real competitions
- ❌ Submissions scattered across platforms (Devpost, slides, demos)
- ❌ Zero real-time intelligence about what's actually happening

**The Cost**: Missed breakthrough ideas, poor talent identification, and competitions that feel more like theater than intelligence discovery.
