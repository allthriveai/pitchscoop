- [ ] **Check MinIO Console**
  - Visit: http://localhost:9001
  - Login: `pitchscoop` / `pitchscoop123`
  - You should see the MinIO admin interface

- [ ] **Run Tests**
  ```bash
  docker compose exec api pytest tests/
  # Should pass all tests
  ```

## üéØ Key Resources

- [ ] **Bookmark These URLs**
  - API: http://localhost:8000
  - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
  - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001

- [ ] **Read Key Documentation**
  - [ ] `README.md` - Project overview and setup
  - [ ] `WARP.md` - Detailed development guidelines
  - [ ] `api/domains/` - Explore the domain structure

- [ ] **Understand the Architecture**
  - [ ] Review the event-driven workflow in README.md
  - [ ] Look at the MCP tools available
  - [ ] Understand multi-tenant design (everything scoped by `event_id`)

## üîß Development Workflow

- [ ] **Learn Key Commands**
  ```bash
  # Start services
  docker compose up --build
  
  # View API logs
  docker compose logs -f api
  
  # Run tests
  docker compose exec api pytest tests/
  
  # Stop services
  docker compose down
  ```

- [ ] **Test API Endpoints**
  - Use the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs
  - Try creating an event, starting a recording, and scoring a pitch

## üé™ Optional: Enable AI Features

If you want to test the full AI-powered features:

- [ ] **Get Azure OpenAI Access** (optional)
  - Ask team lead for credentials
  - Update your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    SYSTEM_LLM_AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
    SYSTEM_LLM_AZURE_API_KEY=your_key_here
    SYSTEM_LLM_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name
    ```

- [ ] **Get Gladia API Key** (optional for STT)
  - Sign up at https://gladia.io
  - Update your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    GLADIA_API_KEY=your_gladia_key_here
    ```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**API not starting?**
```bash
docker compose logs api
```

**Port conflicts?**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8000  # API
lsof -i :6379  # Redis
lsof -i :9000  # MinIO
```

**Docker issues?**
```bash
# Clean restart
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

## ü§ù Getting Help

- [ ] **Check Documentation** - README.md and WARP.md have lots of details

## ‚úÖ Ready to Code!

Once you've completed this checklist:

1. **Explore the codebase** in `api/domains/`
2. **Try the MCP tools** via the API docs
3. **Run the test suite** to understand expected behavior
4. **Pick your first task** from the project board

**Welcome to the team! üéâ**
