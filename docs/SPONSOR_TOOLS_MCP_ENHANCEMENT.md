    historical_index = await llama_index.create_pitch_index(
        all_previous_pitches, embeddings_store=redis_vl
    )
    
    # Find similar historical pitches
    similar_pitches = await historical_index.query(
        current_pitch, similarity_top_k=10
    )
    
    # AI analysis of what made winners vs losers
    success_patterns = await analyze_success_patterns(
        similar_pitches, their_outcomes
    )
    
    return {
        "historical_context": similar_pitches,
        "success_predictors": success_patterns,
