# Competition Demo Recording & Analysis Architecture

## 🎯 Use Case: Competition Demo Analysis
- Record each team's demo presentation
- Generate transcript using Gladia STT
- Analyze transcript for feedback using AI (OpenAI/Langchain)
- Provide structured feedback to participants

## 🏗️ Recommended Architecture

### 1. Recording Session Management
```
Demo Session Entity:
- session_id: unique identifier
- team_name: string
- demo_title: string  
- recording_start_time: datetime
- recording_duration: duration
- status: [recording, processing, completed, failed]
- audio_file_path: string (stored audio)
- transcript: TranscriptCollection
- feedback: FeedbackReport
```

### 2. Real-time vs Post-processing Approach

#### Option A: Real-time Recording + Post-processing Analysis (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros:**
- Reliable recording (no dropped audio)
- Can handle network issues during recording
- Better audio quality control
- Can process multiple sessions in parallel

**Workflow:**
1. Record audio to file during demo
2. Upload audio file to Gladia for batch processing
3. Get high-quality transcript with timing
4. Analyze transcript with AI for feedback
5. Generate and deliver report

#### Option B: Real-time Streaming
**Pros:** 
- Live transcript during demo
- Immediate feedback possible

**Cons:**
- Risk of losing audio if connection drops
- Network dependency during critical demos
- Harder to ensure audio quality

## 🎤 Audio Recording Strategy

### Frontend Recording Options:
1. **Web-based Recording** (MediaRecorder API)
   - Easy to implement
   - Works in browser
   - Good for simple demos

2. **Mobile App Recording**
   - Better audio quality
   - More control over recording
   - Can handle longer sessions

3. **Dedicated Recording Device**
   - Professional quality
   - No battery/network concerns
   - Upload files after each demo

## 📊 Feedback Categories

### Technical Analysis:
- Speaking pace and clarity
- Filler words count ("um", "uh", "like")
- Speaking time vs demo time ratio
- Key technical terms usage

### Content Analysis:
- Problem statement clarity
- Solution explanation quality
- Market/business model discussion
- Technical implementation details

### Presentation Skills:
- Structure and flow
- Engagement and enthusiasm
- Time management
- Call-to-action effectiveness

## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Recording
```
1. Start demo session
2. Begin audio recording
3. Store audio file locally/cloud
4. End recording when demo finishes
```

### Phase 2: Transcription
```
1. Upload audio to Gladia (batch processing)
2. Get detailed transcript with timing
3. Extract speaker diarization if multiple speakers
4. Store transcript with session
```

### Phase 3: AI Analysis
```
1. Pass transcript to OpenAI/Langchain
2. Analyze against feedback criteria
3. Generate structured feedback report
4. Calculate scores and metrics
```

### Phase 4: Report Generation
```
1. Combine transcript + feedback
2. Generate PDF/web report
3. Send to team via email/dashboard
4. Store for competition organizers
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Priority

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
