    Hi everyone, I'm Jane from TechFlow. We're building an AI-powered project management 
    platform that predicts project risks before they happen. 
    
    The problem: 68% of software projects fail due to scope creep and missed deadlines.
    Our solution uses machine learning to analyze code commits, team communication patterns,
    and historical project data to predict risks 2-3 weeks early.
    
    We're already working with 3 enterprise clients and have $50K in recurring revenue.
    We're seeking $500K to expand our AI team and scale to 100 clients by next year.
    
    Our team includes myself (former PM at Google), our CTO (ML PhD from Stanford),
    and our head of sales (10+ years B2B SaaS experience).
    
    Thank you for your time!
